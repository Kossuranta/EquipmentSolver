# Commit Command

When the user says "commit", follow these steps:

## 1. Update `spec/PROGRESS.md`

- Review all uncommitted changes and determine what was done.
- Add entries to the **Decisions Log** table if any new architectural or UX decisions were made.
- Add or update bullet points in the **Notes** section summarizing the work.
- Do NOT change task statuses unless a task was fully completed or started.

## 2. Create Small, Focused Commits

- Group related changes into **small, logical commits** — one concern per commit.
- If changes span multiple unrelated areas (e.g., a feature + a docs update), split them into separate commits.
- Write commit messages following the existing style:
  - Short imperative subject line (e.g., "Add slot names to equipment panel description")
  - Optional body with context (separated by blank line)
- The `spec/PROGRESS.md` update should be its own commit (or bundled with the feature it documents if trivial).

## 3. Push

- After all commits are created, push to the remote.
- Report the commit hashes and a brief summary of what was pushed.

## Shell Reminders

- This is a **PowerShell** environment — use `;` to chain commands, not `&&`.
- Use `git add -A; git commit -m "message"` syntax.
- For multi-line commit messages, use PowerShell backtick-n for newlines: `` `n ``
- Do NOT use bash heredocs (`<<EOF`).
